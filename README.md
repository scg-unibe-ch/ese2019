## General information

* [ESE course page](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese)
* Use <a href="https://piazza.com/unibe.ch/fall2019/ese2019/home">Piazza</a> to ask questions and get answers.

The goal of project in the course "Introduction to Software Engineering (ESE)" is to offer a concrete and practical contact with the phases, techniques, and artefacts of an iterative and incremental software development process.

The lecture builds upon knowledge acquired in P1 and P2:

* P1 was about programming: what is a programming language and what is a program
* [P2](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/p2) was about development: how can we design a solution which follows the state of the art and what are the best programming practices?
* [ESE](http://scg.unibe.ch/teaching/ese) is about software engineering: how can we work in a team to deliver products which meet customer’s expectations

During the project, a concrete software is created through teamwork and it needs to be delivered as a product at the end of the semester — and this is really fun and cool :)

The final grade will be composed from 60% exam + 40% project.

# Project 

This year we will build a '*Sample project*' as a web application.... We, the course assitants (total 4) will act as **clients** and students will act as **developers**. 

# Project organization

Students/participants will be divided into small groups (each group will have roughly 3-4 students). Each group will build the software independently. One student from each group will act as a Product Owner (PO), to which we will release the requirements. PO will then describe the reqirements to his/her fellow developers.

The total duration for the project is 12 weeks. First 4 weeks will be given to learn technologies and clear concepts, also to start developing. The project will be developed as a series of **features**. Project will have three milestones (see [wiki](https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2019/wiki)), at each milestone we will evaluate and retrospect the progress made. Total 8 features will be built by students, out of which one will be a surprise feature by students. The team with best surprise feature will win a gift from us!
